# robots-speed-model
Regression model to find the standard deviation for robot speed with different friction coefficient

To run this clone the repository and run predict.py file. The following necessary packages need to be installed:
1. Scikit library to the model
```
pip3 install -U scikit-learn scipy matplotlib
```
2. numpy
```
pip3 install numpy
```
3. Joblib to read the models
```
pip3 install joblib
```

The Regression models were built using Juypter Notebook, while the prediction is done using only python 3.
